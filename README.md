# Dark Lord Day
## A Chrome Extension for getting some damn tickets to Dark Lord Days

Currently this extension, once enabled and in buy mode, adds 2 tickets for the Dark Lord Days event. This is just a proof of concept and comes with no guarantee that it will work. You are liable for anything that you do with this extension.

## Installation Instructions

	1.) Open Chrome.
	2.) [Download](https://github.com/dasginganinja/dark-lord-day/archive/master.zip) this extension.
	5.) Extract the ZIP file.
	2.) Open up Tools -> Extensions
	3.) Enable Developer Mode (checkbox in upper right hand)
	6.) Drag the dark-lord-days-master folder into the Extensions tab to install extension.
	7.) Extension is now installed.
	8.) Navigate to the presale ticket page and watch it refresh. When it comes time for the event you'll notice tabs pop open and when one successfully goes to the cart the other tabs will close.
	9.) Finish your reservation
	10.) Good luck :)

* The extension must be in buy mode in order for this to work *


## (Dis)arming Buy Mode

** The Extension is permanently in buy mode because of the time I had to develop this. Disable the extension if the event has passed. **

	1.) Click on the beer icon in your Chrome menu
	2.) Click on (DIS)ARM BUY MODE

There may be a banner on the event/cart/checkout pages which toggles the buy mode if I can get around to it.

## Final Note

Please don't rely on this tool to get the tickets. Use a second computer (or Firefox) and to try and get the tickets. If this reserves your tickets then I'm happy for you and please let me know @dasginganinja on Twitter.  Thanks!
