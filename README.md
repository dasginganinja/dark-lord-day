# Dark Lord Day
## A Chrome Extension for getting some damn tickets to Dark Lord Days

Currently this extension, once enabled and in buy mode, adds 2 tickets for the Dark Lord Days event. This is just a proof of concept and comes with no guarantee that it will work. You are liable for anything that you do with this extension.

## Installation Instructions

1.) Open Chrome.
2.) [Download](https://github.com/dasginganinja/dark-lord-day/archive/master.zip) this extension.
5.) Extract the ZIP file.
2.) Open up Tools -> Extensions
3.) Enable Developer Mode (checkbox in upper right hand)
6.) Drag the dark-lord-days-master folder into the Extensions tab to install extension.
7.) Extension is now installed but not yet in buy mode.

* The extension must be in buy mode in order for this to work *


## (Dis)arming Buy Mode

1.) Click on the beer icon in your Chrome menu
2.) Click on (DIS)ARM BUY MODE

There may be a banner on the event/cart/checkout pages which toggles the buy mode if I can get around to it.
