# Dark Lord Day
## A Chrome Extension for getting some damn beers at Dark Lord Day

Currently this extension, once enabled and in buy mode, adds 2 tickets for the Dark Lord Day event. This is just a proof of concept and comes with no guarantee that it will work.

## Installation Instructions

1. Open Chrome.
2. [Download](https://github.com/dasginganinja/dark-lord-day/archive/master.zip) this extension.
3. Extract the ZIP file.
4. Open up Tools -> Extensions
5. Enable Developer Mode (checkbox in upper right hand)
6. Click on the "load packed extension..." button and navigate to the dark-lord-day-master folder. Click on it and select open.
7. Extension is now installed.
8. Navigate to the presale ticket page and watch it refresh. When it comes time for the event you'll notice tabs pop open and when one successfully goes to the cart the other tabs will close.
9. Finish your reservation
10. Good luck :)

## Important Notes
* Your computer must have it's date and time set to the eastern time zone as I don't take timezones into account with this solution and I have a hard-coded date/time.
* It's probably a good idea to sync your computer with the time servers. Look up NTP sync ****your operating system**** for how to do so. This will synchronize your computer's clock with a national source.
* You should probably only *start this 15 or less minutes before the event goes live*
* The event time listed is CST. Look at the countdown timer to be on the safe side.


## (Dis)arming Buy Mode

**The Extension is permanently in buy mode because of the time I had to develop this. Disable the extension if the event has passed to return to normal functionality on eTix.**

## Final Note

Please don't rely on this tool to get the tickets. Use a second computer (or Firefox) and to try and get the tickets. If this reserves your tickets then I'm happy for you and please let me know @dasginganinja on Twitter.  Thanks!

## Liability

I'm not liable for anything that you may do with this extension, including usage and modification.  Use at your own risk.
